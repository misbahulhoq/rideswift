feat(dashboard): Implement user profile management and refactor ride history

This commit significantly enhances the dashboard experience by introducing user profile management and streamlining the ride history display.

- **User Profile Management:** A new `ProfileForm` component has been added, allowing users to update their personal details and change passwords. The main dashboard page (`/dashboard`) now serves as the central hub for profile management.
- **Refactored Ride History:** The generic `DataTable` has been replaced with a dedicated `RideHistoryTable` component for displaying ride history. This new component supports both desktop (table) and mobile (card) views, and the `RiderHistoryColumns` file has been removed, with its logic integrated into the new table component.
- **Dashboard Layout Update:** The dashboard layout's authentication logic has been updated to correctly allow access to the profile page (`/dashboard/profile`) without triggering role-based redirection.
- **API Enhancements:** The `getRide` query in `riderApiSlice` now explicitly defines its return and argument types for improved type safety.
