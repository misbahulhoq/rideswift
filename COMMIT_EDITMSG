feat(rider): Update fare simulation and add ride history API

This commit introduces updates to the ride fare simulation and adds functionality to fetch ride history:

- **Fare Simulation Update:** The simulated fare calculation in the `RideRequestForm` now generates a random fare between 100 and 500.
- **Currency Localization:** The displayed currency symbol has been changed from `$` to `à§³` in the `RideRequestForm` and `RiderHistoryColumns` to reflect BDT.
- **Ride History API:** A new `getRide` query endpoint has been added to `riderApiSlice` to fetch the rider's ride history from `/rides/my-history`.
